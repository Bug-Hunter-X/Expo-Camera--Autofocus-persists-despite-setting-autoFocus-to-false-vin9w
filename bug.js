This bug occurs when using the Expo `Camera` API with custom camera controls.  The issue is that even after setting `autoFocus` to `false` in the Camera props, the camera still attempts to autofocus, leading to inconsistent image quality and unexpected behavior.  This problem is particularly noticeable in low-light conditions or when the camera is focused on a rapidly changing scene.
